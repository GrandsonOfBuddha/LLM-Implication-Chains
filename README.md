# Brain-Computer Interface Learning Platform

A comprehensive web-based platform for exploring brain-computer interface concepts and neural signal processing through interactive visualizations and real-time data processing simulations. This platform provides a complete educational ecosystem for understanding how brain signals are captured, processed, and interpreted in modern BCI systems.

## Complete Implementation Overview

### Foundational Architecture

The platform is constructed as a sophisticated React-based single-page application leveraging TypeScript's type safety features. The entire system follows a modular, component-based architecture where each component has clearly defined responsibilities and interfaces. The application state is managed through a combination of React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) and custom hooks that encapsulate complex logic patterns.

The core architectural pattern follows a unidirectional data flow where:
1. Raw neural data is generated or acquired
2. Data flows through processing pipelines
3. Processed data updates visualization components
4. User interactions trigger state changes that propagate back through the system
5. The cycle continues with real-time updates

### Detailed Component Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Main Application Controller (App.tsx)
The central orchestrator manages the entire application ecosystem through several key mechanisms:

**State Management Architecture**:
- Utilizes React's Context API to create a global state tree accessible by all components
- Implements custom reducers for complex state transitions (neural data updates, user preferences, learning progress)
- Maintains separate state slices for: neural data buffers, visualization parameters, user interaction history, learning module progress, and system configuration
- Uses React.memo and useMemo optimizations to prevent unnecessary re-renders of expensive visualization components

**Component Lifecycle Management**:
- Coordinates mounting and unmounting of visualization canvases based on user navigation
- Manages memory cleanup for WebGL contexts and audio processing nodes
- Implements lazy loading for heavy components (3D brain visualizations, complex signal processing modules)
- Handles error boundaries and graceful degradation for unsupported browser features

**Real-time Data Orchestration**:
